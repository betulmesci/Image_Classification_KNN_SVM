# Image Classification with KNN and SVM

In this project, I used K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithms to
classify house numbers obtained from Google Street View photos dataset. Both models did fairly well 
with KNN providing an accuracy of 65% and SVM providing an accuracy of 66% after some extensive image
preprocessing.
